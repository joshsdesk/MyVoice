## Project Structure

MyVoice follows a standard Flutter Layer-First architecture:

*   `lib/models/`: Data models (e.g., `ChildProfile`, `Word`).
*   `lib/screens/`: UI screens (e.g., `HomeScreen`, `RecordingScreen`).
*   `lib/services/`: Business logic and data access (e.g., `DatabaseService`, `AudioService`).
*   `lib/widgets/`: Reusable UI components.

## Style Guide

*   We use the standard [Dart Style Guide](https://dart.dev/guides/language/effective-dart/style).
*   Run `flutter analyze` before submitting to ensure no errors.
*   Keep code simple and readable.

Thank you for helping every child find their voice! ❤️
