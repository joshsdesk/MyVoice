# MyVoice 🗣️

**A translator for your child's unique voice.**

![App Banner --- placeholder](./docs/images/banner_placeholder.png)

MyVoice is an open-source tool that helps parents and caregivers
**understand and translate their child's unique speech patterns**.\
Many nonverbal or minimally verbal children --- especially in the autism
community --- communicate using **consistent personal sounds** that
don't match standard English but **have real meaning**.

MyVoice lets you:

-   Record what your child actually says\
-   Label what it means\
-   Build a personal dictionary\
-   Translate those sounds for others

It works alongside AAC devices, acting as a bridge between your child's
voice and the outside world.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🎯 The Problem

Children often speak in ways that don't align with typical language, but
their speech is:

-   Consistent\
-   Intentional\
-   Communicative

The challenge: others may not understand these personalized sounds.

MyVoice creates a space to **capture**, **store**, and **translate**
your child's real voice so caregivers, teachers, and family can
understand them.
